# Escratsou Paper
*Escratsou Paper* is meant to be a simple modification to *datapacks*, by introducing easier syntax to the language.

# Datapacks
## Getting Started
*Escratsou Paper* can generate *datapacks* through `datapack.py`. This file can be ran with two parameters, **input path** and **output path**. These parameters are not needed, but the script will choose the demo pack if parameters are not supplied. The datapack will be generated to the output path (default is the `output` directory).

## ESP Meta Format
The *ESP Meta Format* (*pack.espmeta*) is a file included in the datapack that tells the datapack generator program what generator version to use, datapack format, and the description of the pack.
